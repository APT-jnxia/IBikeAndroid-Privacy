### Privacy Policy 

**Effective Date:** May 27, 2024
**Last Updated:** May 27, 2024

**APT (Tianjin) Development Co., Ltd.** (referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” or “the Company”) is the developer and operator of the **I-Bike+** mobile application (referred to as the “App,” “Service,” or “Product”). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information with transparency and care. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the choices and rights you have regarding your data when you use I-Bike+.

By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.

#### **1. Information We Collect**

To provide and improve our core e-bike monitoring services, we collect the following categories of information when you use the App:

**1.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily**
*   Account details (e.g., nickname, email address) when you register or contact our support.

**1.2 Information Collected Automatically**
*   **Device and Log Information:** Device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, IP address, app crash reports, language preference, and dates/times of your access. This helps us ensure service stability and security.

**1.3 E-Bike Health Data (Core Functional Data)**
When you connect your e-bike to the App, we collect and upload real-time operational data to our servers to provide health monitoring. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Battery level and health status
*   Motor performance metrics (RPM, power output)
*   Real-time speed, trip distance, and odometer readings
*   Diagnostic alerts and error codes
*   Other sensor data (e.g., tire pressure, if applicable)

**1.4 Location Information (Precise Location)**
*   **When Collected:** We collect your device’s **precise location (GPS and network-based coordinates) only when**:
    1.  You have explicitly granted the App permission to access your device’s location (via your device settings).
    2.  You are **actively using** a feature that requires location, such as **route recording, navigation, or the “Find My Bike” function**.
*   **Important Clarification on Background Collection: We do NOT continuously collect your location in the background (when the App is not in active use).** Location tracking is active only when the App is in the foreground and you are engaged in a location-based feature.

## 1.4 Background Location Usage

This app requires background location access to ensure continuous Bluetooth communication and navigation functionality during cycling activities.

While riding, the app may continue to receive location updates in the background to:
- Maintain a stable connection with the Bluetooth device
- Record cycling routes and riding data without interruption
- Provide ongoing navigation and riding information when the screen is off

Location data is used only for real-time riding features and is processed locally on your device.
We do not track users, store location history on servers, or share location data with third parties.

#### **3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information**

We **do NOT sell** your personal information. We only share it in the following limited circumstances:

*   **With Your Consent:** We will share information when you direct us to do so.

These partners are contractually bound to use your information **only as necessary to provide services to us** and in accordance with this policy.
    *   **For example:** To display maps, we may integrate the **Google Maps SDK** or **AMap SDK**. These providers may process location coordinates per their own privacy policies solely to render the map interface. We recommend you review their policies.

You have control over your information:
